# odin-recipes

Today, I am going to be coding my first project with the Odin Project, a simple recipes website. I will be demonstrating the basic uses of the markup language HTML, using anything from anchor tags to images in this project. Thank you for reading and sticking around!

!--- DISCLAIMER ---!

I do not own any of these recipes and am just using outside sources for the sake of convenience. Please do not use the recipes displayed in this project, they are merely presented to demonstrate my knowledge and skill of the HTML language.
